<p>This is a toy project where I do write ups about the different graphics programming techniques that I've implemented.</p>
<p>For now I am planning on slowly going through all the GPU Gems and GPU Pro books and implementing most of the techniques layed out within those.</p>

<p>All the implementations will be done in C99 using <a href="https://github.com/erichederstedt/YetAnotherRenderingAPI">Yara</a> as my graphics api. It's an API I made just for this project and is supposed to simplify the most annoying parts of the modern APIs.</p
